	<p id="about_text">Growing up wedged between two brothers I had plenty of rough and tumble, Pirates and cowboy play. There was a plethora of muddy handprints and grass stained shorts. In fact often I came in from playing outside being far more dirty than either of my brothers.<br><br>I needed a little more frill and lace in my life (like most little girls thrive on) not to mention some gracefulness. And so when I was six years old my parents enrolled me in ballet classes at the Bountiful School of Ballet.<br><br>For the next ten years I not only got my fair share of frills and lace, but I also learned how to be a lady. I still had plenty of opportunities to play in the dirt with my brothers but for three hours a week I was able to feel like a princess as I twirled across the studio floor.</p>

If you've participated in any of the many seasonal events, shows, and promotions along Main Street, you have the Main Street Business Association to thank for it.  If you haven't strolled along Bountiful's Main Street for a while, please check out this web site: www.bountifulmainstreet.com for a listing of all of their events. Better yet, go down there and see for yourselves.  There may not be a Festival going on, but you are guaranteed to see dozens of specialty shops and meet several members of Bountiful's vibrant retail community, whose goal it is to make sure you come back, often...JSP</p>
