<div id="about_div2">
	<p id="about_text">Growing up wedged between two brothers, I had plenty of rough and tumble Pirates and Cowboys play. There was a plethora of muddy handprints and grass stained shorts. In fact often I came in from playing outside being far more dirty than either of my brothers. I needed a little more frill and lace in my life, like most little girls thrive on, not to mention some gracefulness. And so when I was six years old, my parents enrolled me in ballet classes at the Bountiful School of Ballet.<br><br>For the next ten years, I not only got my fair share of frills and lace, but I also learned how to be a lady. I still had plenty of opportunities to play in the dirt with my brothers, but for three hours a week, I was able to feel like a princess as I twirled across the studio floor. Even though I spent plenty of time doing "boy stuff" with my brothers, I was never the greatest at sports. I would cringe when the PE teacher said it was time to play baseball or basketball. Bountiful School of Ballet allowed me to be athletic in my own way as I built strength and poise at the barre. I also learned things that would come in handy in the years to follow.<br><br>Some of my fondest memories include having my hair all done up in a million French braids, wearing more makeup than my mom and grandma combined, sporting fabulously sequined costumes and feeling the jittery feeling waiting back stage at a Spring Recital with all of the rest of my giggling ballerina friends.<br><br>Which brings me to the best thing my time at Bountiful School of Ballet brought me -- friends. Wonderfully amazing friends, many of whom I am still friends with today. My close group of friends consists of five girls including myself. Two I danced with at Bountiful School of Ballet. The other two I met through one of the ballet friends. These friendships started out as those giggly moments back stage talking about boys and eating Red Vines. They formed as we stood next to each other, encouraging one another as we did pliés and grand battements over and over trying to reach perfection. But they were solidified as we went through the trials of life together.<br><br>Whether it was high school break ups, surviving finals week in college, eating disorders, depression, or just having a rough day, these girls that I got to know thanks to my years at Bountiful School of Ballet, have all been there for me and for each other, no matter what. Luckily we have more memories filled with laughter than tears. As each other's bridesmaids, we have hosted each other's bridal showers and bachelorette parties and caught each other's bouquets. We have gone on road trips, had countless sleepovers and too many heart felt talks on Bountiful Boulevard than I can count.<br><br>As I sit here watching my baby girl sleep, I pray that she may have friendships like the ones I've been so blessed to have. I simply cannot imagine my life without my best friends. And to think it all started with a bit of frills and lace.</p><br><br>
