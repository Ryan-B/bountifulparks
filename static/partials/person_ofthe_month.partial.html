	<p id="about_text">It may seem ironic that the first about-to-be featured by a site dedicated to the people of Utah's second pioneer settlement is the son of Greek immigrants who settled in Arizona, but nobody in our town better represents the ideals of Bountiful than Mr. Gregory Skedros, regardless of where he started his journey.<br><br>As he approaches his ninth decade, Skedros' entire life has come to define the word Bountiful. Skedros and his late wife Jenny moved to Bountiful from Arizona in 1961 and opened Mountain View Pharmacy on the corner of Orchard Drive and 900 North. Many of today's Bountiful grandparents remember riding their bikes to Mountain View Pharmacy for penny candy and soda pop as kids.<br><br>In 1977, Greg and Jenny put Bountiful on the culinary map when they added the Mandarin Restaurant to their business holdings. The family business struggled at first, but with constant devotion from Gregory, Jenny and their five children, the Mandarin is now regularly rated as the best Chinese restaurant in the Mountainwest. The Skedros family is widely regarded as one of Bountiful's most prominent and contributory families.</p><br>

	<p id="about_text">Now in its 39th year, Skedros' restaurant has drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors to Bountiful from around the world. It has employed thousands of local residents, particularly among our youth. In addition to its positive economic impact for our city, the Mandarin has become the favored place in town to celebrate special occasions and mark significant achievements, all in the welcoming presence of the long-term maitre d' himself. [See Mandarin Restaurant posting under Bountiful Places.]<br><br>The Skedros Family has shared their hard-earned success with the community from the very beginning. They initiated the Salt Lake Greek Festival in 1976 and have contributed generously to their Church and Utah's Greek Community over the years. The tragic 1997 death of their son Anthony led Greg and Jenny to establish the Anthony G. Skedros Memorial Scholarship Fund. It provides education funding for students at Viewmont High School, as well as the Univeristy of Utah and the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, where Anthony trained to be an emergency physician.</p><br>

	<p id="about_text">[See Skedros Scholarship under Support Bountiful.] The Skedros Legacy proves that Bountiful is not just a location. It is a State of Community that can flourish anywhere as long as it is lucky enough to have somebody with the vision and generousity of Mr. Gregory Skedros and his family.</p><br>

	<p id="about_text">Living my life Bountifully involves family, church, friends, and community. I love going to the market on a Saturday evening and seeing friends that we have met all over our little town. Even though Bountiful is part of a very large county, sits on a busy corridor along I-15 on the Wasatch front, and is 15 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Salt Lake City, Bountiful retains a small town feel. It centers on community.<br><br>Spring brings people out of hibernation, and as you drive down the streets, you stop every few minutes visiting with old friends. You don't have to live in Bountiful for a lifetime to know all your neighbors in a five block radius. Walking on Bountiful Boulevard is a hit in our community as well.<br><br> Summer brings quite a lot of lemonade stands hosted by future generations of Bountifulites. You see, people don't always leave Bountiful. Once you've had a taste of this cozy little town, you never want to leave. People usually leave for jobs or education. A favorite of summer is our local Farmers Market. On Thursday afternoons people bring out their produce and crafts, along with the food trucks. I love heading out to this market for great food and crafts, and revisiting with old friends.<br><br>Fall brings a return to school and Friday night football games. Friends and family, usually alumni, pack the stands at these games. Bountiful has two great high schools: Bountiful and Viewmont High Schools. Along with our close neighbor, Woods Cross High, there are plenty of games and the rivalries are alive and well. Look closely at the "B" up on the mountain, and you might see it lit up on a Friday night. Speaking of schools, our little community has the best schools. I might be biased, but our educators rock! I feel justified in my statement as my kids have gone to school in five different cities.<br><br>The capstone of our little town is the LDS Temple. Whenever we are driving home from a long vacation, or flying into the Salt Lake City airport, when we see the Temple, we know we are home. My husband and I have talked for many years of retiring somewhere warmer, we get a lot of snow, but as the years have come and gone, we've become like the beautiful trees in this area. We are deeply rooted in the community and are part of a very large grove of friends. We have loved raising our children here and making great friends along the way.<br><br>Share your own memories and appreciation for Bountiful's Spring evening drives, small town charm,or anything else by clicking CELEBRATE and writing a post or two of your own.
