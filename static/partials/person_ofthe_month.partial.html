	<p id="about_text">It may seem ironic that the first about to be featured by a site dedicated to the people of Utah's second pioneer settlement is the son of Greek immigrants who settled in Arizona, but nobody in our town better represents the ideals of Bountiful than Mr. Gregory Skedros, regardless of where he started his journey.<br><br>

	As he approaches his ninth decade, Skedros' entire life has come to define the word Bountiful. Skedros and his late wife Jenny moved to Bountiful from Arizona in 1961 and opened Mountain View Pharmacy on the corner of Orchard Drive and 900 North.  Many of today's Bountiful grandparents remember riding their bikes to Mountain View Pharmacy for penny candy and soda pop as kids.<br><br>

	In 1977, Greg and Jenny put Bountiful on the culinary map when they added the Mandarin Restaurant to their business holdings.  The family business struggled at first, but with constant devotion from Gregory, Jenny and their five children, The Mandarin is now regularly rated as the best Chinese restaurant in the Mountainwest. The Skedros family is widely regarded as one of Bountiful's most prominent and contributory families.</p><br><br>

	<p id="about_text">Now in its 39th year, Skedros' restaurant has drawn hundreds of thousands of visitors to Bountiful from around the world It has employed thousands of local residents (particularly among our youth).  In addition to its positive economic impact for our city, the Mandarin has become the favored place in town to celebrate special occasions and mark significant acheivements, all in the welcoming presence of the long-term Maitre De himself.  [See Mandarin Restaurant posting under Bountiful Places.]<br><br>

		The Skedros Family has shared their hard-earned success with the community from the very beginning.  They initiated the Salt Lake Greek Festival in 1976 and have contributed generously to their Church and Utah's Greek Community over the years.  The tragic 1997 death of their son Anthony led Greg and Jenny to establish the Anthony G. Skedros Memorial Scholarship Fund.  It provides education funding for students at Viewmont High School, as well as the Univeristy of Utah and the Hennepin County Medial Center in Minneapolis, where Anthony trained to be an emergency physician.</p><br><br>

	<p id="about_text">[See Skedros Scholarship under Support Bountiful] The Skedros Legacy proves that Bountiful is not just a location.  It is a State of Community that can flourish anywhere as long as it is lucky enough to have somebody with the vision and generousity of Mr. Gregory Skedros and his family...JSP</p><br><br>
