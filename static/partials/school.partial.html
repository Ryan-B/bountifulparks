	<p id="about_text">Nobody likes to be called a fool and yet hundreds of people turned up at Bountiful High School on the evening of April 25th knowing that's exactly what they'd be called. Most were called that last year and they'll likely be called that next year too. Fools For Jazz is the annual fund raiser for the Bountiful High Jazz Bands and many Bountiful families make a tradtion out of singing and dancing and eating like fools year after year.</p><br><br>

<p id="about_text">The event, which includes food, music and dancing from the swing era, is a fundraiser for the combined Bountiful High bands. “The band gears up for this for months,” said Lisa Humphries, who is helping with publicity. “All the kids in the whole band come to support it.” The event features the jazz band playing the part of an old-time jazz band, complete with a bandstand. The music focuses on jazz classics, such as those from the Glen Miller era. A dance floor is set up, bubble machines are turned on, and decorations abound. “They transform the old gym into a swing-era dance hall,” said Humphries. “It’s just absolutely charming.” Everyone is welcome to use the dance floor, though at one point an official dance contest is held for interested guests. Judges from different dance studios in the area help weed out some of the early contestants, while other guests help get to decide the final winners via applause. “It’s so much fun,” she said. “People of all ages get involved.” There’s also a costume contest, with attendees dressing up in various swing-era outfits. “The winner is the one who looks most like they would have been there when people were actually singing ‘Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,’” she said. “People really go to town.”</p><br><br>
